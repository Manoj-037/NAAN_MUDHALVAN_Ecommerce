Pre-requisites for Developing TREND'S Full-Stack E-Commerce App
To develop a full-stack e-commerce app using React JS, Node.js, and 
MongoDB, here are the key prerequisites you need to consider:
1. Node.js and npm
Node.js is required to run JavaScript code on the server side. npm (Node 
Package Manager) is included with Node.js, and it's used to manage project 
dependencies.
• Download Node.js:
Node.js download page
• Installation Instructions:
Node.js installation guide for various package managers
2. MongoDB
You need MongoDB to store the data for products, users, orders, and other 
e-commerce information. You can install MongoDB locally or use a cloud-based 
MongoDB service like MongoDB Atlas.
• Download MongoDB:
Download MongoDB Community Edition
• Installation Instructions:
MongoDB installation guide
3. Express.js
Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js. It will handle serverside routing, middleware, and API development.
• Install Express.js: In your terminal, run the following command to install 
Express:
bash
Copy code
npm install express
4. React.js
React.js is a powerful JavaScript library for building interactive user 
interfaces, and it's perfect for creating dynamic, responsive front-end applications.
• Follow this guide to install React:
React Documentation: Creating a New React App
To create a new React app, you can use Create React App:
bash
Copy code
npx create-react-app trends-ecommerce
cd trends-ecommerce
npm start
5. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is essential to structure, style, 
and add interactivity to the user interface of your e-commerce app.
6. Database Connectivity (MongoDB + Node.js)
To connect MongoDB with your Node.js server, you can use Mongoose, an 
Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
• Install Mongoose:
bash
Copy code
npm install mongoose
For more details on connecting MongoDB to Node.js, check out this guide:

7. Front-End Framework (React)
Since your project will use React.js for the front-end, you’ll be building the 
user-facing part of the application, including product listings, shopping carts, user 
profiles, and the admin dashboard using React components.
8. Version Control with Git
Use Git for version control to manage your project’s codebase, track 
changes, and collaborate with other developers. GitHub or Bitbucket can be used 
to host your repository.
• Download Git:
Git download page
9. Development Environment (IDE/Code Editor)
Choose a code editor that you’re comfortable with. Here are a few popular 
options:
• Visual Studio Code:
